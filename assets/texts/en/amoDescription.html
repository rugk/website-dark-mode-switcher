This is an add-on that lets you invert the website's color scheme by inverting/changing the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-color-scheme"><code>prefers-color-scheme</code></a> media feature of CSS without requiring you to change the whole system style setting.

You can also trigger toggling the dark mode with the hot key <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>B</kbd> (customizable in the Firefox add-on settings).


<b>‚ö†Ô∏è Important restrictions ‚ö†Ô∏è</b>
First, remember <b>it only works</b> if websites <b>specifically suport a dark mode</b>. Currently, these may not be so many websites, but you can request them to support it. The number of them supporting it will likely grow soon.

Due to technical constraints, it can currently only <b>force websites to be dark</b>, not to be light. So when your system setting is set to have a dark style, this add-on currently cannot force the websites to be light anyway.
Mozilla is being asked for a better API to change this. You can <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1547818">follow the request here</a>.

This extension only works with Firefox v67 or higher, as this is the first Firefox version that supports this feature.


<b>‚úçÔ∏è Usage ‚úçÔ∏è</b>

You can use a toolbar button to toggle whether it should force a dark mode or not. It displays a yellow moon icon, if it is enabled and forces the website to be dark.


<b>‚õ±Ô∏è Test websites ‚õ±Ô∏è</b>
Here are some websites that already support the dark system style, so you can test them with this add-on:
